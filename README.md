# Welcome to Team Overture 23619's Android Studio Repository for FIRST Globals!

Welcome! This repository contains the codebase for Team Overture 23619, developed for the FIRST Globals 
competition. Our code is structured to optimize efficiency and modularity, ensuring a robust and reliable 
performance during the competition.

 **Overview**

Our code is organized into distinct subsystems, each dedicated to a specific functionality of our robot. 
These subsystems are then integrated into a comprehensive Main System, which orchestrates the control and 
coordination of the entire robot. Below is a brief explanation of how our code is structured:

 **Subsystems**

Each subsystem represents a particular component or functionality of our robot. This modular approach allows us 
to:
- **Isolate and manage individual robot functionalities**: Making it easier to debug and enhance specific parts without affecting the entire system.
- **Build commands**: Commands are constructed using these subsystems, facilitating precise and efficient control.

 **Main System**

The Main System is the heart of our codebase. It:
- **Integrates all subsystems**: Ensuring seamless communication and operation between different components.
- **Defines control logic**: Specifies how the robot should behave and respond to inputs during the competition.

By structuring our code in this manner, we achieve a flexible and scalable solution that can be easily adapted 
and extended as needed.

**Getting Started**

To get started with our code, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Overture-7421/Overture-Globals.git`
2. **Open in Android Studio**: Import the project into Android Studio.
3. **Build and Deploy**: Follow the instructions in the `BUILD.md` file to build and deploy the code to the robot.

We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding and controlling our competition robot.
If you have any questions or need further assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact our team.

Happy coding and good luck in the competition!
